            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the Offence<br>
            Before making a police complaint, it is essential to identify the offence that has been committed. This
            should be a criminal offence such as theft, assault, or murder, or other offenses against property such as
            fraud or criminal breach of trust. It is important to have a clear understanding of the offence so that the
            complaint can be framed accordingly.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Gather Evidence<br>
            Once the offence has been identified, it is important to gather evidence to support the complaint. This
            could include witness statements, photographs, videos, call recordings, chats, or any other relevant
            documents. The evidence should be collected in a systematic and organized manner to make it easier to
            present to the police.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Approach the Police Station<br>
            The next step is to approach the police station that has jurisdiction over the area where the offence was
            committed. It is important to remember that only the police station with jurisdiction over the area where
            the offence occurred can register a complaint. The police station can be approached in person or by phone,
            and the complainant should provide details of the offence and evidence collected.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Lodge the Complaint<br>
            Once at the police station, the complainant should ask to lodge a complaint. The complaint should be in
            writing and should provide details of the offence, the date and time of the offence, and the names and
            addresses of the persons involved, if known. The complaint should be signed by the complainant, and a copy
            should be taken for future reference.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Registering the Complaint<br>
            The police officer in charge of the police station is duty-bound to register the complaint and provide the
            complainant with an acknowledgment receipt. The acknowledgment receipt will have the date and time of the
            complaint, the details of the police officer who registered the complaint, and the complaint number.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Investigation<br>
            After the complaint has been registered, the police will investigate the offence. They may visit the scene
            of the crime, collect evidence, and interview witnesses. The police may also arrest the accused if they
            believe that there is sufficient evidence to do so.<br><br>

            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Filing a First Information Report (FIR)<br>
            If the police find that a cognizable offence has been committed, they will file a First Information Report
            (FIR). A cognizable offence is an offence where the police can arrest the accused without a warrant. The FIR
            will contain details of the offence, the name of the accused, and the names of the witnesses.<br><br>

            An FIR (First Information Report) is a written document prepared by the police when they receive information
            about the commission of a cognizable offense. It is the first step in the process of criminal justice and
            sets the criminal law in motion.<br><br>

            Here are some details about an FIR and its contents:<br><br>

            <strong>Registration:</strong> An FIR is registered by the police once they receive information about the
            commission of a cognizable offense. The person who gives the information is known as the informant.<br><br>

            <strong>Information:</strong> An FIR contains details of the offense that has been committed, such as the
            date, time, and place of the offense, the nature of the offense, and the names and addresses of the accused
            (if known).<br><br>

            <strong>Accusation:</strong> An FIR is an accusation against a person(s) for the commission of a cognizable
            offense. The police register the FIR on the basis of the information given to them and begin the process of
            investigation.<br><br>

            <strong>Signature:</strong> The informant needs to sign the FIR as a confirmation that the information
            provided by them is true to the best of their knowledge.<br><br>

            <strong>Legally binding:</strong> An FIR is a legally binding document and carries a lot of weight in the
            court of law. The contents of the FIR are used as evidence during the trial.<br><br>

            <strong>Importance:</strong> An FIR is an important document as it sets the criminal law in motion and helps
            the police begin their investigation. It is also used to initiate the process of compensation to the victim
            if applicable.<br><br>
